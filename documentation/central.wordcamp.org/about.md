## Welcome to 3 days of WordPress in Paris !

A couple of days after Easter üê£,  The Malesherbes Campus of the Paris La Sorbonne University will be the place to be to :

- contribute to WordPress,
- connect with WordPress enthusiasts,
- and learn about our beloved open source software.

On april 24th, and for the very first time of the WordCamp Paris history: **80** contributors will enjoy a fantastic day dedicated to contributing to WordPress. In other words, we're organizing the first ever **local** Contributor Day in Paris. You can already join us to prepare this day as we're organizing 6 local & livestreamed [workshops](https://2019.paris.wordcamp.org/categorie/journee-de-contribution/) to be fully ready on D-day !

On april 25th and april 26th, **450** attendees (meaning a potential amount of 900 people for the two days) will be able to connect to each others and learn about WordPress thanks to a single track of conferences.

Everyone is welcome and we really hope to see you there ! But if you can't make it : no worries, we will livestream everything !
